## [Curriculum vitae](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22319736/CV.pdf)

## Areas of interest

I'm mostly focused on developing new skills and expanding old ones within these areas:
- Operating Systems
- Algorithms
- Low-Level Programming
- Artificial Intelligence
- Distributed Systems

## Engineering Thesis
[AlkOS](https://github.com/Jlisowskyy/AlkOS) - Operating system developed from the ground up, with the primary objective of implementing a process scheduler. It features an interrupt handling infrastructure, a `gtest`-like testing module, implemented C/C++ standard library portions, multi-core support, and fundamental kernel data structures.

## Private projects

  - [pyradiomics-cuda](https://github.com/PiotrTyrakowski/pyradiomics-CUDA) - GPU-accelerated extension of PyRadiomics for shape feature extraction, achieving up to 1000x speedup on NVIDIA H100.

## Hackathon Projects  

I have participated in numerous hackathons, gaining valuable experience and expanding my skills. Some of the events I took part in:  

- **BestHackingLeague 2024 - Cyber** – **1st place**  
- **AngelHack 2024 Warsaw** – **2nd place** and advancement to the global finals in Singapore
- **HackYeah 2024** – **2nd place** in the Lifestyle category  
- **AngelHack Grand Finals Singapore 2024**  
- **Llama Hackathon 2024**  
- **AngelHack 2024 Bounties** (multiple times)  

Project repositories can be found in my repository list.
